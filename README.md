# Wine-Quality-Predictor
Machine Learning Model to Predict Wine Quality Based on Physicochemical Features

# Wine Quality Predictor

This machine learning project predicts the quality of red wine based on various physicochemical features using classification models in Python.

## Dataset

- [Wine Quality Dataset (UCI)](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine+quality)
- Size: 1,599 samples, 12 features
- Target: Wine quality (score from 3 to 8)

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas & NumPy
- scikit-learn (Logistic Regression, Random Forest)
- Matplotlib & Seaborn

## Workflow

- Data preprocessing (null check, scaling)
- Feature correlation analysis
- Model training and evaluation
- Accuracy, confusion matrix, classification report

## Visualizations
